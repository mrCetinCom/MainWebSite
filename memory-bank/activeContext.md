# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Finalizing the implementation of a multi-language, theme-aware, and highly animated promotional website for "mrCetin Software".
- Ensuring all interactive elements, including navigation, language selection, and theme switching, are visually consistent, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Recent Changes

- **Logo Overlap Fix:** The main hero section logo animation was adjusted to prevent it from overlapping with the fixed header on smaller screens. The hero section's top padding was also increased.
- **Clickable Header Logo:** The logo in the header is now wrapped in an anchor tag (`<a>`) that links to the top of the page (`#`).
- **Day/Night Theme Switcher:**
    - A theme switcher has been added to the header and the mobile menu.
    - The entire site's color scheme was refactored using CSS variables to support light and dark themes.
    - The header, hero logo, and other elements now change color based on the selected theme.
    - The user's theme preference is saved in `localStorage`.
- **Header Control Sizing:** The size of the language selector and theme switcher in the header has been adjusted multiple times based on user feedback to find a good balance between readability and compactness.
- **New Languages (French & Italian):** 
    - Added "Fran√ßais" and "Italiano" to the language selection dropdowns in `index.html`.
    - Added complete translation objects (`fr` and `it`) to the `translations` constant in `script.js`.

## Next Steps

1.  Review and update the remaining files in the `memory-bank` to ensure they reflect the current project state.
2.  Await further user feedback on the recent visual and functional changes.
3.  Proceed with more advanced animations, contact form implementation, or performance optimization as directed by the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Component Sizing:** There is an ongoing balance between making text readable (larger) and keeping control elements (buttons, selectors) compact. The current implementation reflects the latest user feedback, but may be subject to further refinement.
- **Theming:** The CSS variable-based theming system is now a core part of the site's architecture. All new components should be built to be theme-aware.
- **Localization:** The translation object is growing. For a larger site, this approach might become difficult to manage. For the current scope, it remains effective.
