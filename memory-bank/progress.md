# Progress

## What works

- Existing `index.html` file has been backed up to `index_backup.html`.
- Memory Bank has been updated to reflect the new web design project context and current task.
- Basic HTML structure for the website, including header, navigation, content sections, comprehensive footer links (Privacy Policy, Cookie Usage, Terms of Use, Legal, Sitemap), a multi-language selection dropdown, and an animated logo in the `hero-section`, has been created in `index.html`.
- All static text content in `index.html` has been updated with `data-i18n` attributes for multi-language support.
- `style.css` has been updated to incorporate a vibrant color palette (white, black, red, turquoise) and reflect apple.com's minimalist and modern design principles, including typography, spacing, a subtle gradient animation, styling for the language selector, initial styles for scroll-triggered animations with staggered reveal effects for elements within sections and the hero section, and styles for the continuous, blurred logo animation in the `hero-section`. The logo's height has been increased to `280px`. The `logoFadeInBlur` animation has been refined to start clear (`opacity: 1`, `blur(0px)`) and higher (`translateY(-80px)`), briefly blur and fade out (`25%` keyframe with `opacity: 0.5`, `blur(5px)`), then reappear clear (`30%` keyframe with `opacity: 1`, `blur(0px)`), and remain clear and prominent for a longer duration. The starting `translateY` is `-120px` and `scale` is `0.5` for a more dynamic entrance. The `hero-section`'s `padding` has been reduced to `100px 0` and `margin-top` set to `0` to reduce the overall top spacing. The `hero-animated-logo`'s `margin-bottom` has been reduced to `10px`.
- `script.js` has been updated to include comprehensive translation data (`translations` object) for all supported languages and a `setLanguage` function to dynamically update page content based on selection. The `setLanguage` function is now explicitly called on `DOMContentLoaded` to ensure immediate translation. The `Intersection Observer API` implementation for scroll-triggered animations now includes the `.hero-section` in its observed elements, leveraging the staggered CSS transitions for a more engaging effect and resolving the issue of content disappearing on scroll. The `observer.unobserve(entry.target);` line has been removed, and an `else` block has been added to `Intersection Observer` to remove the `is-visible` class when an element is no longer intersecting, allowing animations to re-trigger on subsequent scrolls.
- All instances of "Yazılım Firması" in `index.html` and `script.js` (within translation data) have been successfully updated to "mrCetin Software".
- Contact information (address, phone, email) has been added to the `contact` section in `index.html` with `data-i18n` attributes, and corresponding translations have been added to the `translations` object in `script.js`. New styles for `.contact-info` have been added to `style.css` to ensure proper alignment and visual appeal with Font Awesome icons. Font Awesome CDN has been added to `index.html`.
- Vision and Mission texts have been added to their respective sections in `index.html` with `data-i18n` attributes, and corresponding translations have been added to the `translations` object in `script.js`.
- The `applications` section in `index.html` has been populated with three project cards (two game projects, one mobile app project), each with a title, description, and status (`In Development` or `Coming Soon`), all marked with `data-i18n` attributes. Corresponding translations for these project details and statuses have been added to the `translations` object in `script.js`. New styles for `.project-grid` and `.project-card` have been added to `style.css` to ensure a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout.
- The detailed "About Us" text has been integrated into the `about-us` section in `index.html`, split into multiple paragraphs, each with a `data-i18n` attribute. Corresponding translations for these paragraphs have been added to the `translations` object in `script.js`.
- The logo in the header (`header .logo img`) has been increased in size to `60px`.
- The main hero section logo animation was adjusted to prevent it from overlapping with the fixed header on smaller screens. The hero section's top padding was also increased.
- The logo in the header is now wrapped in an anchor tag (`<a>`) that links to the top of the page (`#`).
- A Day/Night theme switcher has been added to the header and the mobile menu. The entire site's color scheme was refactored using CSS variables to support light and dark themes. The header, hero logo, and other elements now change color based on the selected theme. The user's theme preference is saved in `localStorage`.
- The size of the language selector and theme switcher in the header has been adjusted multiple times based on user feedback to find a good balance between readability and compactness.
- French and Italian have been added to the language options. This included adding the new languages to the `select` dropdowns in `index.html` and adding complete translation objects (`fr` and `it`) to the `translations` constant in `script.js`.

## What's left to build

- Detailed implementation of more advanced animations and interactive elements to further enhance the "animated and eye-catching" requirement.
- Development of the contact form functionality.
- Final performance optimization and accessibility checks.
- Deployment of the website.

## Current status

- The foundational structure of the website (HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript) is now fully functional, inspired by apple.com's aesthetic, incorporating the specified vibrant color palette, including fully integrated multi-language selection, sophisticated scroll-triggered animations for sections with staggered content reveals, and a continuously animated logo in the hero section that starts clear, briefly blurs and fades out, then reappears clear, positioned higher and larger. The footer includes all required legal and informational links. The issues with translations not appearing and content disappearing on scroll have been successfully resolved, and animations now re-trigger on every scroll, providing a continuous dynamic experience. The company name has been updated across all relevant files. The spacing between the logo and the top bar has been optimized. Contact information has been added and translated across all supported languages, and the contact section has been visually enhanced with icons and proper action links. Vision and Mission statements have been successfully integrated into their respective sections and are available in all supported languages. The "Our Applications" section now features concrete examples of two game projects and one mobile application project, clearly indicating their development status, which effectively showcases the company's current work and future plans, and these details are fully translated. The detailed "About Us" text has been successfully integrated into its section and is available in all supported languages. The header logo has been increased in size. The project is ready for the next phase, which involves enriching the visual design with more advanced animations, populating the remaining content sections, and further refining the user experience. A day/night theme switcher has been implemented and the color scheme has been refactored to use CSS variables. The theme preference is saved in local storage. French and Italian languages have been added.
